# JITLine-replication-package

This repository contains source code that we used to perform experiment in "JITLine: A Simpler, Better, Faster, Finer-grained Just-In-Time Defect Prediction" paper.

The source code implementation for our approach is in [JITLine](https://github.com/awsm-research/JITLine-replication-package/tree/master/JITLine "JITLine") directory.

Please follow the steps below to reproduce the result

1. create conda environment (or skip to step 3. if conda environment is not needed)
2. activate conda environment
3. enter command "pip install requirement.txt" to install required package
4. run jupyter notebook
5. go to "./JITLine/" then open "JITLine_commit_level RQ1-RQ3.ipynb"
6. run all cells in that notebook
