This repository contains source code that we used to perform experiment in "JITLine: A Simpler, Better, Faster, Finer-grained Just-In-Time Defect Prediction" paper.

The source code implementation for our approach is in [JITLine](https://github.com/awsm-research/JITLine-replication-package/tree/master/JITLine  "JITLine") directory.
  
Please follow the steps below to reproduce the result

1. go to "./JITLine/" directory

2. run the command "conda env create --file requirements.yml" to create conda virtual environment

3. enter "conda activate JITLine" to activate conda environment

4. run the command "jupyter lab" to start jupyter notebook server

5. open and run "JITLine_RQ1-RQ3.ipynb" and "JITLine_RQ4.ipynb", to get result of RQ1-RQ3 and RQ4 respectively.
