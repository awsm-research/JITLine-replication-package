# JITLine-replication-package

This repository contains source code that we used to perform experiment in "JITLine: A Simpler, Better, Faster, Finer-grained Just-In-Time Defect Prediction" paper.

The source code implementation for our approach is in [JITLine](https://github.com/awsm-research/JITLine-replication-package/tree/master/JITLine "JITLine") directory.

Please follow the steps below to reproduce the result

1. create conda environment by entering command "conda env create --file environment.yml"
2. enter "conda activate JITLine" to activate conda environment
3. run jupyter notebook
4. go to "./JITLine/" then open "JITLine_commit_level RQ1-RQ3.ipynb"
5. run all cells in that notebook
