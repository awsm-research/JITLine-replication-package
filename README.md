# JITLine-replication-package

This repository contains source code that we used to perform experiment in "JITLine: A Simpler, Better, Faster, Finer-grained Just-In-Time Defect Prediction" paper.

The source code implementation for our approach is in [JITLine](https://github.com/awsm-research/JITLine-replication-package/tree/master/JITLine "JITLine") directory.

Please run the jupyter notebook following the steps below to reproduce our experiment.

 1. run code in JITLine_commit_level.ipynb to train commit-level model
 2. run code in JITLine_line_level.ipynb to train line-level model
 3. run code in JITLine_commit_level_eval.ipynb and JITLine_line_level_eval.ipynb to obtain experiment result
